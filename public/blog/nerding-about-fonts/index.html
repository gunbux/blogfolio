				<blockquote>This post is somewhat inspired by<br>a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKjpUCCyHu8&ref=localhost">great video about fonts by Tech Craft</a>. I highly recommend you check<br>it out if you're interested in fonts and typography.</blockquote><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I was thinking of what a good first blog post would be, and I thought this would be a pretty whimsical topic to write<br>about. Fonts are a <strong>deeply personal</strong> choice, and I think it's not only a fun topic to over-analyze, but also a fun<br>and relatively easy subject to completely overthink and talk about.</p><p>It's not something that people tend to bring up in conversation, and is <strong>really easy to underappreciate</strong> the thought<br>that has been put into something as simple as font design.</p><h2 id="what-are-some-really-good-fonts">What are some really good fonts</h2><p>I think the best way to appreciate good fonts is to use a really good one. Once you start, you find it really hard to<br>get used to any other fonts. For programming, that font has been <strong>JetBrains Mono</strong>. I've yet to have come across any<br>other fonts that are as good as it.</p><p>Of course, for most people, programming isn't everything, and for everyday use, Apple (and Steve Jobs in particular)<br>has pioneered the use of <em>sans serif</em> fonts to great effectiveness, making fonts such as <strong>Inter</strong> and <strong>Roboto</strong> are<br>great choices.</p><h2 id="why-fonts-matter">Why fonts matter</h2><p>I'm not particularly fond of Apple products, due to their closed nature and their wildly draconian anti-repair stance.<br>However, I do think Steve Jobs very eloquently some of the deep thought put into typography design in<br>his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&ref=localhost">2005 Stanford commencement speech</a>:</p><blockquote>I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to [learn calligraphy]. I learned about serif and sans-serif<br>typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It<br>was beautiful. Historical. Artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating. None<br>of this had any hope of any practical application in my life. But 9 years later, when we were designing the first<br>Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.</blockquote><p>Which is a really fancy way of saying they really don't have any practical importance, yet have a certain allure once<br>you understand the level of detail put into them.</p><h2 id="the-best-font-for-the-best-job">The best font for the best job</h2><p>Fonts drastically change the way we perceive text. Comics would look out of place<br>with Times New Roman and your emails<br>would feel comical in Comic Sans. A well designed font<br>is one that does the job it requires.</p><h2 id="jetbrains-mono">Jetbrains Mono</h2><p>Most software developers who have some knowledge of typography would've definitely come across, and rave<br>about Jetbrains Mono. The Jetbrains team has done wonders to make it<br>one the best fonts for any form of programming and development.</p><p>It's really difficult to appreciate it at first, but once you try using other fonts for development, you'll realize how<br>much it helps. Hopefully this helps you understand why.</p><blockquote>To appreciate the really cool details of Jetbrains Mono, I'll skip some of the fundamentals of a good coding font<br>(monospace, legibility, etc.)</blockquote><h3 id="jetbrains-mono-as-a-vector-font">Jetbrains Mono as a vector font</h3><p>This might not seem like a big thing at first, but having a vector font significantly helps in a <strong>universal development<br>environment</strong>. Throughout a career in development, you'll have to work with numerous different equipment. This means<br>working with monitors of different sizes and resolution. While you may not encounter this at all, more than likely,<br>you'll bump into a monitor or two with an unusual scaling factor. When this happens, normal bitmap fonts have this<br>'fuzzy' texture that makes them extremely hard to read, especially for long periods.</p><p>This is especially so on Microsoft products, such as Visual Studio or VS Code in their default Consolas font, where they<br>use something called ClearType to smooth fonts out. This causes a blurry messy font on low dpi monitors, and personally<br>unpleasant long reading sessions otherwise.</p><p>Having a vector font solves this on <strong>every</strong> resolution. I haven't seen anyone with any readability issues on Jetbrains<br>Mono ever, on any platform on any screen.</p><h3 id="font-height-and-design">Font height and design</h3><p>Another few of those small changes that go such a long way. Once again, it's really hard to describe the nuances until<br>you've compared fonts, but comparing something like <strong>Source Code Pro</strong> for example, you'll notice that:</p><ol><li>it doesn't feel as <em>monospaced</em> as Jetbrains</li><li>it somehow doesn't feel as readable?</li></ol><p>It was really hard to explain it till I started looking at good typography design, but essentially, the issues were with<br>the standard font heights and 'shape' of letters. Letters with big circles and rounded shapes tend to take up more space<br>naturally, so a monospaced font usually accounts for that by having the largest letters as the unit size per letter.<br>However, due to the disparity of sizes of the smallest and the biggest sized letters, monospace fonts tend to feel<br>very spacious.</p><p>Jetbrains gets around this by replacing most of their large circles with <strong>pill-shaped ovals</strong>. This makes it so that<br>the disparity is much lesser, and makes it feel more 'm o n o' as each character feels like it takes up the same space.</p><p>The font height, particularly of lowercase letter is another just ingenious trick that Jetbrains uses. Just eyeballing<br>the values, most lowercase letters on standard fonts are ~60-70% of the maximum height of the font. JetBrains Mono seems<br>to use about 10% more than other fonts. And it makes <strong>so much sense</strong>.</p><p>When you are working on a HiDPI monitor, you tend to use smaller fonts, often around 11-15px. Even with high dpi, fonts<br>can get really hard to read, especially when you've been coding for hours. Maximizing the height given to a font to make<br>the lowercase alphanumeric so much more legible significantly helps readability, especially over a long period.</p><h3 id="built-by-developers-for-developers">Built by developers, for developers</h3><p>You can really tell that the good folks at Jetbrains are hardy developers themselves. Discriminators, or the<br>distinctiveness of similar symbols is crucial in development, especially as one mistype can be impossible to spot in<br>thousands of lines of code. '1lI' and '0O' for example are so distinct<br>in this font that you can never mistake them for each other.</p><p>It's not just the big issues that were addressed in this amazing font. Even the smallest details, such as ligatures were<br>added into this font. No longer will you confuse '=' and '' and '=' any more.</p><p>And just like any great equipment in a developer's toolkit, Jetbrains Mono is licensed under an Open Font License, which<br>means we get a <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/?ref=localhost">nerd font</a> variant, which allows us to really use this font anywhere from<br>terminal applications to integrated development environments.</p><h2 id="san-francisco-pro-satoshi-or-literally-any-san-serif-font">San Francisco Pro, Satoshi, or literally any san serif font</h2><p>Well, why don't we use Jetbrains Mono for everything we do then? Well, Jetbrains Mono is quite a specialized fonts<br>tunnel visioned at developers. This means that a lot of it's features that made it so great for development, makes it<br>really bad for other purposes. The 'rounded rectangle' typeface becomes really boring and uninteresting. The<br><strong>serifs</strong> (or the little tails at the edge of letters) which were used to add distinctiveness introduce a lot of<br>clutter into the font.</p><p>This is where the sans serif fonts comes to great effect. Sans serif literally means without serif, and it is what is<br>used to described the clean, uncluttered typeface made popular by Apple. You may recognize the famous font of<br><strong>SF Pro</strong>, the default Apple font on all their products. The 'clean and minimalist' design makes it really good for<br>blogs, writeups or any kind of long form writing outside of development. My personal favourite font in terms of design<br>is <strong>Satoshi</strong>, which is also what this blog uses. There's something special about the font that I just can't describe,<br>other than I like it.</p><h2 id="what-makes-a-good-font">What makes a good font</h2><p>I think the conclusion or answer to this question is <em>it depends what you're using it for</em>. Some fonts have been<br>specially designed for a niche purpose, and I think it's really important in the area of design to appreciate the good<br>thought put into great typography.</p>
